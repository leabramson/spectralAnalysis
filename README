First revision -- 04 May 2016

This folder contains the first round of GLASS sources
for which full-spectrum SPS modelling will be performed,
with the specific aim of identifying stellar population
gradients.

The sources are listed below and found in the directories
named by the associated cluster fields ("M1149", etc.).

The selection criteria were:

    1.0 < z < 1.8 && mag_GLASS < 21 (ORIGINAL SAMPLE)
    1.0 < z < 1.8 && mag_GLASS < 21.5 (AS OF 6 MAY 2016)
    
(see both columns below). Selection was performed using the
"Master" GLASS catalogs on L.E. Abramson's laptop (soon to
be ported to MIKADO) in March 2016, and the routines CUTONMAG.pro
and CUTONZ.pro also located there. As of that time, catalogs
had been compiled for 6 clusters.

All sources are drawn form the central GLASS pointing, for which
both G102 and G141 data are available.

Original sample: ('allCl_1.2_1.8_20_21.list' + masses & SFRs from Takahiro's FAST fitting; the "1.2" is a typo)

The files associated with each source are:

    1. glassID_PA_grism_region.pyspec -- the 1D extracted spectrum for
       				      	 source "glassID" in a given cluster pointing.
				     	 "PA" is either "1" or "2" (one for each
				     	 GLASS PA), "grism" is "B" or "R"
					 for G102 or G141, respectively, and "region"
					 is "inner", "inter", or "outer" depending on which
					 radial section of the 2D spectrum the 1D trace was
					 extracted from. As of May 2016, these came from
					 radial regimes:

					 inner ... |r| < 0.25 r_e
					 inter ... 0.25 < |r| < 0.75 r_e
					 outer ... 0.75 < |r| < 1.50 r_e

					 These regimes are defined and the 1D spectra are
					 extracted using EXTRACT_1.pro on L.E. Abramson's
					 laptop (soon to be ported to MIKADO). They are then
					 reformatted into ASCII files by WRITEFORPYSPECFIT.pro
					 to have 4 columns: "WAVELENGTH FLUX ERROR MASK", where
					 wavelength is in the OBSERVED frame and MASK = 1 for
					 GOOD pixels. Errors are extracted from the "eht"
					 extension from the GLASS 2D spectrum files in the
					 same radial boxes as the 1D traces.

					 R_e is calculated from Moffat profile fits to the
					 direct image of a target (FITS extension "dsci") collapsed
					 along the spectral direction.

    2. glassID_PA_grism_region.lsf    -- the line spread function for the same target as the
       				      	 above. Also calculated in EXTRACT_1.pro, but taken as
					 a Moffat fit to the direct image collapsed in the
					 SPATIAL direction. (I.e., same LSF for all radii; this
					 should be improved in future iterations).

Fitting procedure is:

	"mpirun -np XX python fitspec.py glassID_PA REGION redshift redshift_prior_width outputDirectoryPrefix"

Code is from DREW NEWMAN. Must run "source $PYSPECFIT/bashdef" or it won't work!

With few exceptions, there is one "good" PA per source.

Error calculations were off by a factor of sqrt(SENSITIVITY) until 03 May 2016. -- CORRECTED
